# mdm-gen
Master Data Generator -- Nestable, Customizable and Scalable

mdm-gen is the result of years of frustration in not being able to experience data in the user context. 

Every user has a different story.

      Why shoud the variety of data be a limiting factor (minus doing a six month POC)?
      
      Why should that variety not be realistic ?
      
        For example,
	
          If the random zipcode (94086) is randonly chosen, why should the state not be automatically be California?

	  If I choose a state of California, why shouldnt all the zipcodes randomly generated under that state be in California?
	  
          Why, when I create a stream of events, should those events be not directly relatable to the Master Data?
	
      Why shouldn't that variety be extensible ?
      
	  Why can I not provide a simple cut-n-paste functionality that would enable thousands of users experience their data their way?
	
          Even if I cannot imagine all the variety of data being generated,
	
          Why shouldn't the plumbing be provided so that to extend the porcelin to account for that variety?

Fundamentally mdm-gen operates on a json file to produce json data. You need nodejs and redis on your Linux machine to run these examples.

HelloWorld of mdm-gen.js
       examples/helloworld/company.json
	    is likely the simplest example. (It actually has more instructions than the data it produces)

	    company.json content:
	 	      {
		          "paths": 
      		     	     [
	  		          {"path": "/", "entityName": "company"}
      			     ],
    			     "entities":
    			     [
				 {"entity": "company", "fields":
		 	  	 	    [
						{"field": "company_name", "fieldFunction": "company.companyName()"}
		 	  		    ]
		      	          }	
    			      ]
                         }
			 
             nodejs mdm-gen.js examples/helloworld/company.json
	                    produces
     	          {"company_name":"Keebler - Sipes"}

With repeatibility in mind

             nodejs mdm-gen.js examples/helloworld/company.json 3
	     	          produces
		  {"company_name":"Oberbrunner, Treutel and Hilll"}
		  {"company_name":"Crist - Hansen"}
		  {"company_name":"Orn, Bins and Wuckert"}

		  company_name is randomly generated

	     *.json is the instruction file of how to produce entities (potentially nested).
	          company.json reads like this
		  	       1. Produce a entity called company at root level ({"path":"/"})
			       2. The entity company has one field called "company_name" and is satisfied by a magic-o-function called company.companyName()
With nestability in mind

	examples/helloworld/company-with-nesting.json
	
	     mimked after a  file-system -- not to be taken literally
	          / --> company
		  /company --> addresss

             	  nodejs mdm-gen.js examples/helloworld/company-with-nesting.json
		  
		  company-with-nesting.json content
		  
			{
				 "paths": 
      				 	  [
						{"path": "/", "entityName": "company"},
	 					{"path": "/company", "entityName": "address", "min": 1, "max":3, "distribution": "random"}
      					  ],
    				"entities":
					  [				
					  	{"entity": "company", "fields":
		 					   [
								{"field": "company_name", "fieldFunction": "company.companyName()"}
		 					   ]
					        },
						{"entity": "address", "fields":
		 					   [
								{"field": "streetAddress", "fieldFunction": "address.streetAddress()"},
		     						{"field": "zipCode", "fieldFunction": "address.zipCode()"}
		 					   ]
						}
    					]
			}

                produces a random number (between min: 1 and max:3) of addresses for a company.

			 {
				"company_name":"Kub - Hilll",
				"address":[
						{"streetAddress":"76836 Brandt Spring","zipCode":"77377-3723"},
						{"streetAddress":"16669 Cydney Forge","zipCode":"62540-6315"}
					  ]
			}


With nestability taken a little bit far

      			    	     [

	  				{"path": "/company", "entityName": "user", "min": 1, "max":5, "distribution": "random"},
	 				 {"path": "/company/user", "entityName": "userAddress", "min": 1, "max":1, "distribution": "random"}
	  			     ],
    		            "entities":

		 					   [
